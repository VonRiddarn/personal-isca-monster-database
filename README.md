## Important notice
This project was initially developed without utilizing modules and later made the switch.<br />
Hence, some files have a huge co-dependency issue that does not reflect upon clean code.<bt />
In the best of worlds, we would adress this, but since the scope for this project is so low I will leave it.

## Development team
Developed solely by Timmy "VonRiddarn" Ã–hman.
