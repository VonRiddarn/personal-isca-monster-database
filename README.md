## Important notice
This project was initially developed without utilizing modules and later made the switch.<br />
Hence, some files have a huge co-dependency issue that does not reflect upon clean code.<bt />
In the best of worlds, we would adress this, but since the scope for this project is so low I will leave it.

## What is this?
This is more or less a carbon copy of the group project with the same name.<br />
As I really liked this project I wanted to have a go at it on the side seeing what I could achieve alone. <br />
This project is not nearly as pretty as the original, but should have a cleaner code base and scale better.<br />
Developed solely by Timmy "VonRiddarn" Ã–hman.
